Physical Activity Readiness Checkup Before Exercising

Sudden Cardiac Arrest is the abnormality of heart function that causes ineffective heartbeat or disrupts the heart’s pumping actions, making the heart stop beating unexpectedly. Sudden cardiac arrest can happen in everyone who has no known underlying diseases. With this abnormality, the heart cannot pump sufficient blood to other organs, causing loss of consciousness. The condition can even be fatal.  



Reasons to Undergo a Health Checkup Before Running

The Exercise Stress Test is an assessment that examines whether the heart experiences a lack of blood and oxygen during strenuous exercise. This test offers an initial assessment of the state of the patient’s cardiovascular function. It can also analyze whether the patient is suffering from arrhythmia from exercising. In addition, the test can assess the patient’s physical fitness. Results of an Exercise Stress Test provide for a more detailed discussion than results from an Electrocardiogram. 



How to Prepare for Heart Function Screening

Do not have a heavy meal or alcoholic beverages 3-4 hours prior to the test; Light dishes — such as porridge and congee — are exceptions.



Consult with the doctor regarding any medications you are currently taking whether they should be stopped before undergoing the screening, e.g. , medications for heart disease or high blood pressure. 



CT Calcium Scoring

Calcium deposits can be found on the walls of the coronary arteries, heart valve, or pericardium. Calcification of the coronary arteries is a serious condition. It is a degenerative process that occurs over many years before the symptoms of heart disease become apparent.  According to a study, coronary artery disease can be predicted by the amount of calcification, along with other risk factors, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels or smoking.  Coronary artery calcification increases risk of acute heart attacks (myocardial infarction) due to a sudden blockage of blood flow in the artery. 



Who cannot undergo a coronary calcium scan?

People with a history of coronary stent implantation or prior coronary artery surgery

People who have limitations in lying down

People weighing more than 180 kg

Pregnant women

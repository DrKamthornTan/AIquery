New Shingles Vaccine

New Shingles Vaccine: Recombinant subunit zoster vaccine (RZV)

This type of vaccine does not contain live varicella-zoster virus, instead it uses specific proteins called glycoprotein E that are contained in the virus. 



97% efficacy rate in preventing shingles among adults aged 50 and older.

91\.2% efficacy rate in preventing postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). 

89% efficacy rate in preventing shingles over a 10-year monitoring period

Vaccination Recommendations:



Recommended for adults aged 50 and above, who will require two shots in the muscle of the upper arm, with a 2- to 6-month gap between doses.

Recommended for individuals aged 18 or older who are at higher risk of developing shingles than the general population, such as those with compromised immune systems, individuals taking steroids, and those undergoing radiotherapy or chemotherapy treatments, as they are more susceptible due to their weakened immune systems. These groups will receive two shots in the muscle of the upper arm, with a 1- to 2-month gap between doses.

Since the shingles vaccine is a new type and does not contain a live virus, it is safe for individuals with compromised or weakened immune systems.

The shingles vaccine can be administered regardless of whether the individual has previously had chickenpox. It is not necessary to check for immunity to chickenpox (varicella IgG) before vaccination.

In cases where a person has had shingles before, the shingles vaccine can be administered with a minimum of a 6-month gap since the latest shingles episode.

If the patient is not yet at an age considered suitable for the shingles vaccine, they may be given the chickenpox vaccine first. However, it is not recommended that patients receive a shingles vaccine to protect against chickenpox.

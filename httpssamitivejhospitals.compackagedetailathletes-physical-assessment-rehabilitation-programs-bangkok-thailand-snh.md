Physical Assessment and Rehabilitation Programs for Athletes – Samitivej Srinakarin Hospital

Before Fit Program

What is the Before Fit Program? 

A cardiovascular and general health screening program aimed at runners and athletes, the Before Fit Program is used to analyze the fitness of a runner, athlete or sports enthusiast before they compete or participate in their chosen sport or a running event. Should a condition or irregularity be detected during this pre-activity analysis, especially a heart disorder, it means the athlete could be placing himself/herself at risk of a serious health event or even death which can occur without warning during exercise. Moreover, screening results can be used to design a tailored training regimen as well as instill confidence prior to competition.



Which groups are suited to the Before Fit Program?

Runners preparing for a long-distance race, such as races covering a distance of 10km or more. 

Runners and athletes wishing to undergo screening prior to the start of a training regime. 

Sports enthusiasts who are interested in finding out more about their bodies before beginning an exercise regime.

VO2 Max Physical Screening Program

The VO2 Max Physical Screening Program analyzes a person’s maximum cardiovascular and lung functioning capabilities in order to determine the limits of their physical ability. The screening measures the maximum amount of oxygen the individual can utilize during exercise—VO2 Max—which is a gauge of their physical fitness (a high measurement represents a high level of fitness). The screening also assesses the individual’s metabolic, respiratory, and cardiovascular systems’ response to exercise. The results of the screening can show a person how much exertion is possible at that time, enabling them to increase these limits safely by tailoring training to fit the resulting zones.



Patients can opt to include our Running Analysis Program which analyzes running gait, foot placement, weight distribution, and stance in order to assess the risk of injury and determine the cause of injuries while running. These injuries may be due to a runner’s gait, muscular imbalance, muscle weakness, and a range of other potential causes. The analysis can be used to make adjustments or to train runners in the correct running techniques to ensure they make sufficient progress, increase muscle mass, and reduce the risk of injury.

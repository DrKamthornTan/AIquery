Influenza Vaccine for Seniors 65+

10% of all elderly influenza patients cannot perform daily tasks
independently, resulting in them relying on others. Additionally, 1 in 3
elderly patients who require an overnight hospital stay end up incapable
of independent tasks even after one year of receiving treatment.

Influenza affects elderly patients more seriously than other groups,
with their risk of stroke 8 times greater, and risk of myocardial
infarction 10 times greater, than the general population.

In studies of elderly Americans and Canadians aged 65, the elderly
influenza vaccine offered patients up to 24.2% greater protection
against the influenza virus when compared with 4-strain influenza
vaccines.

The studies also showed that the elderly influenza vaccine reduced
hospitalization and mortality rates resulting from various other
complications more than the 4-strain influenza vaccines:

A 64.4% reduction in hospitalization from influenza or pneumonia.

A 48.9% decrease in the mortality rate.

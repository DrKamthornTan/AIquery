Healthy Kid Programs

Why are children\'s health check-ups essential?

Children undergo highly specific changes at each stage of their
development, so their health must be monitored and assessed much more
than in adults. Monitoring and preventing illness, recommending
age-appropriate nutrition, and undergoing additional screenings such as
eyesight exams, hearing assessments and blood screening, are all things
that parents should prioritize.

Which specific assessments should be carried out at each stage?

Cranium measurements for children under 2 years of age

At least one hearing assessment using specialized equipment during the
first 6 months

Hearing assessments by a pediatrician, from 4 months to 6 years of age

Developmental screening at 9 months, 18 months and 3 years of age

Blood pressure screening and eyesight examinations for children aged 3
and above

First visit to the dentist between 1-2 years of age

Hematocrit screening at 6-12 months, at 3-6 years, and in adolescent
females

Preparation for Check-up Program:

Your child should be completely healthy, as Illness may influence the
results

Dress your child in comfortable clothing that is convenient to change
out of

Do not consume any food or drink for 8 hours before the check-up (only
for Healthy Kid Advanced Package).

Ensure that your child has sufficient rest the night prior to the
check-up

Avoid heavy meals the day before the check-up as they may affect blood
glucose and blood fat levels

Bring your child\'s vaccination diary

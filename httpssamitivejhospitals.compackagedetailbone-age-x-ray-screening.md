Precocious Puberty Screening & Bone Age X-ray Program

Precocious puberty is a condition in which children mature faster than
usual.

It can affect both girls and boys, raising concerns for parents.

However, early detection allows timely correction, safeguarding the
child\'s physical and mental well-being.

At what age does puberty normally occur?

Girls typically begin maturing between the ages of 8 and 13.

Boys typically begin maturing between the ages of 9 and 14.

What are the characteristics of precocious puberty?

Girls may notice breast development, often feeling firm breast tissue in
the areola. This can occur on one or both sides. If these signs appear
before age 8, it may result in rapid growth and early menstruation.

Boys may experience an increase in testicle size, rapid growth, acne,
the development of pubic hair, underarm hair, and facial hair before the
typical age for such changes.

Why is it necessary to conduct a bone age X-ray?

Conducting a bone age X-ray is essential to determine abnormal rapid
bone growth, which can result in issues such as premature growth
cessation, incomplete physical development, and physical abnormalities.
This examination helps identify effective treatment strategies, ensuring
age-appropriate physical growth and preventing psychological issues
linked to precocious puberty, which can affect a child\'s
self-confidence and expose them to teasing or bullying.

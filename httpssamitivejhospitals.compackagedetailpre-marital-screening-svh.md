What is a Premarital Health Screening?

A Premarital Health Screening is a screening to assess overall health in
order to prevent the transmission of communicable diseases between
spouses, and to protect future offspring who may unknowingly be placed
at risk in the case of parents being carriers of disease. This screening
helps mothers prepare for pregnancy, and can help families plan to give
birth to healthy children. Generally, screening includes the following:

Blood Tests

General Physical Examination Performed By Doctors

What is Preconception Genetic Screening?

Preconception genetic screening, also known as carrier screening, is an
option for individuals or couples planning to have children. The
screening involves analyzing DNA to determine whether the individual
being screened is a carrier of inherited gene mutations associated with
genetic disorders. While carriers typically do not show symptoms of the
disease, they can pass on mutated genes to their offspring, potentially
resulting in the inheritance of genetic disorders, making this
information of particular use in informing family planning decisions.
Such genetic disorders can be hidden in parents who are carriers and can
be found in both Thai and foreign populations. Currently, such screening
can detect more than 400 genetic disorders.

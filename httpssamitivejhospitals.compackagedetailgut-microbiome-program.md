Gut Microbiome Screening Program

Do you have signs of microorganism imbalance?

Are you experiencing:

Bloating, diarrhea or constipation

Chronic inflammatory acne

Allergic rashes that come and go

Difficulty losing weight

Did you know there are 5,000 kinds of microorganisms in the gut?

Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) detection of good and bad microorganisms in the body can analyze more than 100 species of microorganisms.

Gut microbiome screening uses stool testing to check for healthy and unhealthy gut bacteria. The test can ascertain several important pieces of information, from the levels of more than 100 different gut microbiota species to their potential relationship with the patient’s level of risk regarding the following 9 conditions:



Obesity

Chronic irritable bowel syndrome

Diabetes

High cholesterol

Cardiovascular disease associated with meat intake

Colon polyps

Depression

Rheumatoid arthritis

Age-related macular degeneration

Imbalance of gut microbiota

Healthy microbiome homeostasis helps to form a protective mucus layer for epithelial cells, preventing harmful bacteria from penetrating the intestinal wall. An imbalance of beneficial bacteria in the digestive tract may increase your chances of developing diseases such as chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which are caused by bacterial imbalances. When pathogenic bacteria are increased, including during use of antibiotics, pathogenic bacteria can penetrate cells resulting in inflammation and the risk of disease.

Glaucoma Screening Package

Understanding the 4 facts of Glaucoma, a danger without warning

There were approximately 76 million glaucoma sufferers worldwide in
2020.

Glaucoma tends to be symptomless, but in the last stage patients will
experience gradual blurred vision, and there is a risk of complete
blindness if left untreated.

Glaucoma can be treated with eye drops, laser treatment or surgery to
lower eye pressure.

High risk factors for glaucoma:

Over age 40

High eye pressure

Family history of the condition

Regularly taking steroid medication

Underlying health conditions such as diabetes

Previous eye injury

Extreme myopia or hyperopia

Preparing for your eye test

Patients should get sufficient sleep (6 -- 8 hours) the night before
testing

Patients should not drive themselves to the appointment

Patients should bring sunglasses for use after the test

The Eye Clinic at Samitivej Srinakarin Hospital is offering a glaucoma
screening package as part of our World Glaucoma Week campaign, available
through Mar 16, 2024.

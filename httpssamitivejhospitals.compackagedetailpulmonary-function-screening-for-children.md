Lung Function Screening Program for Children

Is the ongoing PM2.5 situation affecting children?

Children are affected by PM2.5 levels higher than 35 µg/m3 (24 hour average).

Children with allergies and asthma have a higher sensitivity to particulate matter, and exposure to PM2.5 particles can cause children’s symptoms to worsen more easily than in the general population.

Parents should avoid letting children engage in outdoor activities, both at school and elsewhere, when PM2.5 levels are unsafe.

If children experience symptoms such as runny nose, coughing, chest tightness, difficulty breathing, eye irritation, eye watering or eye redness, they should see a pediatrician for a check-up.
